# Exploratory-Analysis-Titanic-Dataset

The goal for this lab was to practice Spark's Machine Learning API by creating a machine learning model to predict if a passenger would survive or not, therefore is a classification problem.

Steps:
- try to find and remove outliers.
- try new features or drop existing features.
- try different feature transformations.
- try different feature scalers.
- try different algorithms and parameters.
- try cross-validation or train-validation split with grid parameters
